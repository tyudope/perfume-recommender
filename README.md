# 🌸 Perfume Recommender — AI-Driven Fragrance Recommendation System

> **An AI-powered perfume recommender that blends semantic search, data-driven ranking, and GPT-4o reasoning to suggest fragrances based on user preferences, use-cases, and scent profiles.**

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **hybrid recommender system** designed to suggest perfumes tailored to user preferences.  
It combines **machine learning**, **information retrieval**, and **GenAI explainability** using a clean **FastAPI + Vanilla JS** stack.

Users can:
- Input their **favorite perfumes** and **preferred notes**
- Set filters (price, gender, longevity, sillage, rating)
- Get **ranked recommendations** based on semantic similarity
- Optionally enable **AI explanations** powered by OpenAI GPT-4o-mini

## 🧠 Core Idea

Perfume preference is deeply **semantic** — users think in scents and moods, not numbers.  
This system captures that by embedding perfumes into a **vector space** where semantic similarity drives recommendations.

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Semantic Search** | Uses text embeddings or TF-IDF vectors to find perfumes similar to user input |
| **Hybrid Ranking** | Combines similarity with rating, longevity, and popularity |
| **Explainable AI** | GPT-4o-mini provides short, natural-language reasoning for top results |
| **Clean UI** | Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; mobile-friendly and intuitive |

## 🧮 Algorithm

### 1. Semantic Vector Search

Each perfume is represented by a **text vector** built from its:
```
brand + name + main_accords + description
```
We compute **cosine similarity** between the user query and all perfumes:
```
similarity = (A ⋅ B) / (||A|| * ||B||)
```

### 2. Rule-Based Filtering
Filters apply constraints such as:
- `price_min`, `price_max`
- `rating_min`, `rating_count_min`
- `longevity_min`, `sillage_min`
- `gender`

### 3. Weighted Ranking
Final ranking score:
```
score = 0.40*content_sim + 0.15*usecase + 0.15*longevity +
        0.20*rating + 0.10*rating_count
```

### 4. Use-case Scoring
A small overlap metric to check fit between user’s selected use-cases and perfume accords.

### 5. GenAI Explanation Layer
Top-K results get reasoning generated by `GPT-4o-mini`, returning two concise bullet points explaining *why* it matches the user.
